Thanks for contributing! Any and all contributions are welcomed and encouraged.

## How can I contribute?

You can contribute in many ways and do not have to be an expert coder -- identifying bugs and useful improvements are valuable contributions! In any case, there are a few steps you can follow to ensure your contribution is able to be addressed as quickly as possible.

1. Make sure you have read through the [README](README.md). Your contribution may already be addressed here.
2. Look through existing issues to see if yours already exists. If it does, give it a thumbs up. Add a comment if you additional context to provide.
3. Open a new issue using the relevant template. Follow instructions, be detailed, be patient, and be respectful!

### Reporting Bugs

If you come accross a bug -- something that is not working as you think it should -- please let us know! Once you have checked the README and issues, try to reproduce the bug. What command exactly leads to the error and what exactly is wrong about the behavior? If there is an error message, include it in your report. Walk us through how you came to the bug so we can replicate it and diagnose it.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If there is a feature you wish the repository had (additional stations, states, etc) and no open issue for it, open one. Describe what addition you would like to make in detail and what use case you think it has.

### Developing a New Feature

- If an issue is not open for the feature you would like to develop, open one following [Suggesting Enhancements](#suggesting-enhancements).
- Check if a Pull Request is already open for this feature -- no need to repeat someone else's work!
- Once you have confirmed that an issue is open for your enhancement and no Pull Request is, fork the repository and open a Pull Request with a descriptive title starting with [WIP] (work in progress). We want you to open your PR early so others can see what is being done and avoid repeating work. Link the relevant issue to the PR. 
- Add a test for your new feature
- Remove the [WIP] once you believe you are done. We'll review your PR and get back to you


### Fixing a Bug

- If an issue is not open for the bug you would like to fix, open one following [Fixing a Bug](#fixing-a-bug).
- Check if a Pull Request is already open for this feature -- no need to repeat someone else's work!
- Once you have confirmed that an issue is open for your bug fix and no Pull Request is, fork the repository and open a Pull Request with a descriptive title starting with [WIP] (work in progress). We want you to open your PR early so others can see what is being done and avoid repeating work. Link the relevant issue to the PR. 
- Add a test for your bug that passes with your fix, but fails without it. 
- Remove the [WIP] once you believe you are done. We'll review your PR and get back to you
