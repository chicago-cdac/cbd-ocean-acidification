# Oceanographic Data Source Documentation

## NOAA NERRS
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Estaurine Research Reserve System (NERRS) contains many sensors on the US west coast that collect time series acidification data. 

Through correspondance, data may be submitted to state agencies, but must follow several guidelines, included in the [manual](http://cdmo.baruch.sc.edu/request-manuals-admin/pdfs/CDMOManualv6.6.pdf). Data should not be held and redistributed after 3 months, QAQC flags must be included, and sources should be cited. Data goes through one round of review quarterly and one round yearly which must be submitted for review by March 15 of the following year. According to the manual "After the CDMO performs the final tertiary QAQC, the data will be posted as authoritative." 

To retrieve data with full QAQC results, a [webservices](https://cdmo.baruch.sc.edu/web-services-request/) acount connected to a static IP must be used. 

## King County

King County Washington has Ocean Acidification monitoring sensors in Puget Sound. They have a slightly outdated [work plan](https://your.kingcounty.gov/dnrp/library/2015/kcr2661.pdf) and communicated through email that they hope to updated Sampling and Analysis Plans for all Mooring and Ocean Acidification Programs by the end of 2022.
